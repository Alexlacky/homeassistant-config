# dmatik’s Home Assistant configuration

I’m using Lovelace mostly for my mobile devices and for Wallpanel tablet which some times used with HaDashboard instead.

The UI is partially isnspired by [Homekit Infused](https://github.com/jimz011/homekit-infused), implemented by me using mostly Custom Button Card and Delluttering Card for the templates.
